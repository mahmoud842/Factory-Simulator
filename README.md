### Key Features

- **Production Line Simulation**:  
  Machines and queues can be interconnected to simulate complex production lines, allowing for realistic modeling of manufacturing processes.

- **Dynamic Project and Product Management**:  
  Users can select the total number of projects, and products are visually represented as colored boxes in queues. Machine colors dynamically change to indicate when they are processing a product.

- **Multi-Threaded Machine Operation**:  
  Each machine operates on its own separate thread, enabling concurrent processing and efficient resource utilization.

- **Real-Time Simulation Updates**:  
  Integrated WebSocket communication streams real-time updates from the backend to the frontend, providing a smooth and interactive visualization of the simulation.

- **Thread-Safe Queue Management**:  
  Queues implement a bulking mechanism to handle concurrent access by multiple threads, ensuring data integrity and efficient processing.
